falling gems game.

Collect falling gems using "A" and "D"
to move and "SPACE" to jump. each falling
gem you collect will spawn 2 more in the 
sky! collect as many as you can to beat 
your high score! 

do not let the gems hit the ground, or you 
start over! once enough gems have been 
collected you can use a power up by 
pressing "E" when prompted.

an apple will drop from a ramdom location.

ground, the player gains a temporary speed 
boost for 5 seconds!
